README

I have correctly implemented my github account, my home page, and my bio, as well as some basic HTML and CSS elements. I'm struggling to fix certain elements of my CSS and HTML at the moment. I have collaborated with one of the TA's. 

So far I have spent about five hours combined trying to figure out how to set everything up correctly and learning how to put this website together.

		Hi, my name is Alejandro Osio. I was born and raised in New York City and currently attend Tufts University. I'm majoring in Engineering Psychology and Economics. This summer I'll be working at Google!

		Here's a very brief summary of how my interests have progressed: as a small boy I loved to draw. In high school, much of my focus was devoted to wrestling. Now in college, I have taken a great interest in user-centered design, marketing, and technology.
